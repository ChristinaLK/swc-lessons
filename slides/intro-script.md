Software Carpentry exists to fix, or at least improve this situation, by giving scientists formal instruction in computing tools.  The following video - while not directly about computers - captures the philosophy that we're trying to share.  

Warning: bit of swearing

(Can start the video below around ~1:00 if you're short on time)

What does this have to do with computing?  Just like Casey Neistat has organized his studio in a way that optimizes his productivity, our goal is to "organize" your computer in a way that allows you to be the most productive (could include, reproducible, etc.) scientist you can be.  

So like Casey Neistat's studio, we'll be organizing, giving you some tools, and the ability to create your own tools.  Note that the order of this list is deliberate - this is not a "python" workshop or a "git" workshop.  More tools without processes will just be more crap in your workshop, your computer.  We'll be learning about these tools as part of our workshop, but we'll be focusing more on processes and ways of thinking that can transform the way you interact with your tools and which tools you use.  Best practice is our byword here.  

Let's talk briefly about expectations then.  Obviously, these are quite lofty goals, and (fellow instructors) and I are not "professional" instructors, although we all have training and experience in doing this kind of thing.  Also, you all (usually) come from different backgrounds and experience levels, so there will be times today and tomorrow where you are in over your head or bored or both.  At the very least, we hope that you gain at least one or two really useful tools, practices or insights that will help you in your research, and the motivation and understanding to keep learning on your own.
