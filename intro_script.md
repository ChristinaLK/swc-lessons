Part of what makes (what's his name) a good artist is not just that he has a lot 
of tools in his workshop, but that those tools are organized in a way to enhance 
his productivity.  He has a schema, so to speak, around his work.  So we, today, 
are going to go over two things: 

- Tools
- Best practices

We will be using a specific programming language - python -  and a specific version
control software - git - and even, possibly, a specific database version - sqlite - 
but hopefully you will also pick up principles from these lessons that will 
apply across the board, if you're using other tools.  
So not just adding tools to your computing workshop, but how to use those tools 
in the best possible way.  

Ways of thinking about solving problems using computing that will translate.  
You are supposed to tell your computer what to do, instead of the other way around.  
So I think the real goal here, is empowerment to do your research as best you can.  
(The real goal is to give you enough information to continue onward.)

This will look different to different people!  
For some of you, to whom this is all new, if what you walk away with is knowing 
more about a specific tool - that's good too!  You have all come in here with 
different backgrounds, so some people want more tools, others may want more 
best practices and tricks, and for some of you, this may be all new.  We'll try 
to hit as much as possible, and we're all learning together.  Be patient with each 
other.
